The Washington Post's Jennifer Roesch reports that as of April 10, the Federal Elections Commission would have until Jan. 1 to certify the election results. The election's results will go to Gov. Mary Fallin, who faces a strong challenge in the coming primary. But they only have two options to avoid a November primary, he told CNN.

I said this a little bit to my wife, and they responded by saying my book is more about the music you hear in our living room, while all the rest I'm just talking about is what we know of our own lives.
